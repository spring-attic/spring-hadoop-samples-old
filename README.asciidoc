== Sample Applications for Spring for Apache Hadoop

This repository contains several sample applications that show how you can use
Spring for Apache Hadoop.  The applications are located in the directory +samples+.  

The directory +original-samples+ and +docs+ are copies of the example application code and documentation that were shipped in Spring Hadoop 1.0.0.M2.  They will be migrated into the +samples+ directory and removed soon.

=== Overview of Spring for Apache Hadoop

Hadoop has a poor out of the box programming model.  Writing applications for Hadoop generally turn into a collection of scripts calling Hadoop command line applications.  Spring for Apache Hadoop provides a consistent programming model and declarative configuration model for developing Hadoop applications.

Together with Spring Integration and Spring Batch, Spring for Apache Hadoop can be used to address a wide range of use cases
* HDFS data access and scripting
* Data Analysis
** MapReduce
** Pig
** Hive
** Cascading
* Workflow
* Data collection and ingestion
* Event Streams processing

=== Features

* Declarative configuration to create, configure, and parameterize Hadoop connectivity and all job types (MR/Streaming MR/Pig/Hive/Cascading)
* Simplify HDFS API with added support for JVM scripting languages
* Runner classes for MR/Pig/Hive/Cascading for small workflows consisting of the following steps HDFS operations -> data analysis -> HDFS operations
* Helper “Template” classes for Pig/Hive/HBase
** Execute scripts and queries without worrying about Resource Management Exception Handling and Translation
** Thread-safety
* Lightweight Object-Mapping for HBase
* Hadoop components for Spring Integratio and Spring Batch
** Spring Batch tasklets for HDFS and data analysis
** Spring Batch HDFS ItemWriters
** Spring Integration HDFS channel adapters

== Additional Resources

The samples were taken from the O'Reilly book link:https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024767.do[Spring Data].  Using the book as a companion to the samples is quite helpful to understanding the samples and the full feature set of what can be done using Spring technologie and Hadoop.
