  <title>Requirements</title>

  <para>Spring for Apache Hadoop requires JDK level 6.0 (just like Hadoop) and above,
  Spring <ulink url="https://www.springsource.org/about">Framework</ulink> 3.0
  (3.1 recommended) and above and <ulink
  url="https://www.gemstone.com/products/gemfire">Hadoop</ulink> 0.20.2
  (1.0.0 recommended) and above. Regarding Hadoop-related projects, SDHP
  supports <ulink url="https://hbase.apache.org/">HBase</ulink> 0.90.x, <ulink
  url="https://hive.apache.org/">Hive</ulink> 0.7.x and <ulink
  url="https://pig.apache.org/">Pig</ulink> 0.9.x and above. As a rule of
  thumb, when using Hadoop-related projects, such as Hive or Pig, use the
  required Hadoop version as a basis for discovering the supported
  versions.</para>

  <para>Spring for Apache Hadoop also requires you have a Hadoop installation up and
  running. If you don't already have a Hadoop cluster up and running in your
  environment, a good first step is to create a single-node cluster. To
  install Hadoop 0.20.x+, the <link
  ns6:href="https://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/stable/#Getting+Started">Getting
  Started</link> page from the official Apache documentation is a good general guide.
  If you are running on Ubuntu, the tutorial from Michael G. Noll, "<link
  ns6:href="https://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-hadoop-on-ubuntu-linux-single-node-cluster/">Running
  Hadoop On Ubuntu Linux (Single-Node Cluster)</link>" provides more details.
  It is also convenience to download a Virtual Machine where Hadoop is setup
  and ready to go. Cloudera provides virtual machines of various formats <link

  You can also download the <link

  HD</link> distribution or get a tech preview of the <link

  distribution</link>.</para>
